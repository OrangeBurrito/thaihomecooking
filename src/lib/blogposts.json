			"snippet": "One of the most unique aspects of this class was that our day started with a trip to the market, where we told Angsana the 3 dishes we had decided we wanted to make (no pre-set menu!).<br>We felt like we were truly being immersed into Thai life, experiencing how the locals shop.<br><br>Bottomline: If you are ever in Bangkok, you must take a class from Angsana.  This was one of the highlights of our trip, and our only regret is that we didn’t sign up for two classes! "

If I am ever in Bangkok I am 100% going back."

			"snippet": "One of the reasons we decided Angsana was best is because it is a private lesson for just the two of us and it truly is HOME cooking. The class is taught in a kitchen at the back of her home in Bangkok.<br><br>So if you are in Bangkok and want to learn how to cook that delicious Thai food in your home, Angsana is a wonderful choice!"

			"snippet": "The highlight of our time in Bangkok was a private cooking class we took (at the last minute).<br><br>  At the time you call for your appointment, she asks you which dishes you’d like to make – she makes suggestions if you are stumped – and her cashew nut chicken is to DIE FOR! She does all the shopping for you before you arrive and you sit down at the end to the lunch you have just prepared – so rewarding!"
